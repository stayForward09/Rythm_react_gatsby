  Our lovely assistants Inna, Jelena and Renie are always there to help you and
  answer your questions.

  They take orders (apparatus and equipment), help with leotard measurements, explain everything about events and competitions and if you are new, they'll introduce you to our school, they'll explain our philosophy and all the things you need to know about us.


  All our helpers are DBS checked and are currently registered to the BG.
