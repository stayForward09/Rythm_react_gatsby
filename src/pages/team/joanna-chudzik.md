UKCC Level 1 Coach, level 2 judge

Asia started her adventure with Rhythmic Gymnastics at the age of 7. She
trained under a watchful eye of Alicja Urbaniak in UKS Jantar in Gdynia,
Poland where her biggest achievement was the 4th place in under 10 free
routine on National Competition. At the age of 12 Asia had to resign from
sport due to an illness.

Now she continues her passion for rhythmic gymnastics while coaching others
and occasionally practicing on her own.
