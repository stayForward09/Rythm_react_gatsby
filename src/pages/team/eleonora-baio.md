  Eleonora has an infinite love for RG that leads her to travel to any possible
  destination to watch live the main events (world championships, world cups and
  many more).


  This is what she says about herself:


  I never have enough of RG, since I first discovered it until now I haven’t stopped loving it! I keep studying (as my passion has now become my job) and researching as we never finish learning!


  I love my team: with Stefano it has been love at first sight, we understand each other just looking into our eyes, we make a great partnership even though we don’t miss out discussing sometimes; we’ve been through a lot together and he’s been supportive and helpful as a brother can be. We recently had the privilege to prepare a young gymnast to participate in the World Championships and I’ll never forget all the emotions we felt during that time. The weekend after that incredible event we won the junior national title with our top gymnast Saffron Severn, we became the happiest coaches in the world!

  Francesca and Asia are with us for quite a few years now and I couldn’t be happier, I feel we are a young team but a big family.

  <blockquote class="otro-blockquote">It is just coming up to a year me being with Rhythmic Excellence but it feels like so much longer as they made me feel so welcome when I joined. I have funny memories from the Italy competition, one was when we were having dinner one night I tried ordering the table whilst Eleonora was whispering in my ear what to say, one of the biggest reasons why I love the coaches here at Rhythmic Excellence is that even though they are strict we still have fun times.<span>Rebecca</span></blockquote>
