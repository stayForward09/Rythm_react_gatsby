Currently taking her UKCC Level 1 Rhythmic Gymnastics Coach

Evina started ballet at the age of 4, reaching RAD Ballet Grade 2, and then trained for a couple of years as an artistic gymnast at first. After Greece got the bronze medal in the group all-around competition in the 2000 Olympic Games, she soon started training as a rhythmic gymnast. Her greatest inspiration is the Greek rhythmic gymnast and World and European Champion, Eirini Polydorou, who guided her in her first steps in the sport. After many years of training, she decided to quit the sport at the age of 16, due to injuries. A few years later, she rediscovered her love and passion for rhythmic gymnastics, when she started to work as a RG coach in her home country, Greece. She has just moved to London and has decided to take the UKCC Level 1 Rhythmic Gymnastics.
