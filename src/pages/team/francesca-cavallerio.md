details: |-
  Level 3 rhythmic gymnastics coach and national judge, Francesca started her
  career as a gymnast at 4 in her hometown in Italy. Although gymnastics was
  always her passion, it was when she started to assist her coach that she
  realised that what she loved the most was coaching rhythmic gymnastics and be
  able to pass on her love for the sport to younger girls. Francesca has been
  coaching since 2001 and in 2005 she opened her own gymnastics club in Italy,
  S.G. Concordia. After many years working as head coach and developing gymnasts
  who competed at a regional and national level, Francesca decided to expand her
  horizons and, following her studies in Psychology in Turin, moved to London to
  do an MSc in Sports Psychology. The MSc turned into a PhD, during which
  Francesca studied and observed the environment of rhythmic gymnastics from a
  more academic perspective. Having completed her PhD in 2016, Francesca
  currently is a lecturer in Sports Psychology at Anglia Ruskin University but
  continues to nurture her passion for gymnastics through her role as a national
  judge, occasionally coaching, and helping gymnasts develop their love and
  experience in gymnastics in a positive and healthy way as a sports
  psychologist.
