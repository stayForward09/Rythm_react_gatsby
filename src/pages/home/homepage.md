**[Rhythmic Excellence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRxN1Yk1A5w)** is a highly professional Rhythmic Gymnastics school founded in April 2015 by *Stefano Sirianni* and *Eleonora Baio*. \
**Rhythmic** is the name of the gymnastics discipline we love, study and teach, **Excellence** is the goal toward which we strive. Our aim is to give each gymnast the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential, so we work on meeting the needs of each individual athlete. We promote athletic development and psycho-physical growth, encouraging and enabling gymnasts, especially young children, to understand their minds and bodies, and to appreciate sport. 

*What is Rhythmic Gymnastics?* \
RG is a discipline which blurs the boundaries between sport and art. It combines the elegance and gracefulness of ballet, the drama of theatre, and the athleticism and flexibility of gymnastics. \
RG is a recognised sport which became competitive in 1940. At the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, RG was introduced for individual competition, followed by group competition at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Rhythmic gymnasts perform with rope, hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon on a 13x13 sq metres carpet individually or in a group of 5 and always accompanied by music. 

*What do we offer at RE?* \
We offer recreational courses every day for kids from 4 years old up and adults beginners once a week. Our squad gymnasts are selected following a period of training and trial; they may be drawn from our existing team of young athletes or admitted as newcomers. \
Our squad gymnasts train professionally 5/6 days per week, including some mornings for those competing at an international level. We are fully dedicated to the British Gymnastics competitive development plan and attend all events in the competition calendar for individual gymnasts (we also have plans to begin a group programme soon). Our gymnasts have also the chance to participate in international competitions, shows and events.

*Our philosophy* \
We believe in a triangle of collaboration and trust between gymnast, coach, parents where all parties have their important roles: the coach teaches, the gymnast learns and the parent supports. We're eager to keep learning every day and acknowledge that each experience is a treasure. As Rome wasn't built in a day, a gymnast doesn't become a champion in a day either! There is a long period of preparation for gymnasts before they're able to begin competing and it takes years before they become well-rounded gymnasts, master techniques, and refine the quality of their skills. But this is all possible with a long-term plan which is tailored for each gymnast and patiently worked on.

*A big Team!*\
We take this opportunity to acknowledge that we wouldn't be where we are today without the admirable work of all our coaches past and present, and those who have given us their trust and support. We want to send a special shout-out to Mrs *Karen C*: the generosity and positivity you have shown us has been heartwarming.

All our coaches, teachers, and volunteers are DBS checked; our coaches have also passed a Safeguarding and Child Protection Course.

Gymnasts in our club must be registered with British Gymnastics.
