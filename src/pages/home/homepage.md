Rhythmic Excellence is a highly professional Rhythmic Gymnastics school founded in 2015 by Stefano Sirianni and Eleonora Baio. “Excellence” as in the type of training we provide for our gymnasts to meet the individual needs of each performer. Our aim is to work in performing arts, sport development and promotion, encouraging and enabling gymnasts, especially young children, to understand, appreciate and become more involved in gymnastics. Students will have the chance to participate in Gymnastics Home & International competitions, shows and events. We welcome children and adults of all ages with the goal of training to ensure the best outcome for each gymnast. Those principles in order are:

* Cardio
* Endurance
* Strength
* Flexibility
* Coordination

We believe in the triangle Gymnast, Coach, Parents based on a strong collaboration and trust between all parties and in which everyone has their important roles: the coach teaches, the gymnast learns and the parent supports.

All Coaches, Teachers, and Volunteers are CRB checked and have passed Safeguarding and Child Protection Course.

All gymnasts must register to the British Gymnastics.
