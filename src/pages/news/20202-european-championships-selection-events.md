Our junior gymnasts Dana and Leyla and our senior Saffron have attended the first 2 selection events and the test ranking after which:

* Saffron has been selected to represent GBR at the Pesaro ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹and Baku ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿World Cup that will take place in April;
* Leyla has been selected to represent GBR at the Irina cup (Warsaw ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±) and the Prize of Yana Batirchina (Baku ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¿)

Dana has not start well and have perform very unclean routines at the first event but managed to push harder and completed well the second selection doubling her scores.

Leyla has achieved some of her PB and ranked 3rd in both selection events.

Saffron is recovering well from her foot injury and managed to win the first event and ranked 3rd at the second (introducing back many elements thanks to her foot getting better and better).
