Dear Families and Friends,

As you may be aware we made the difficult decision of suspending all Rhythmic Excellence classes until the end of April.

The UK Government announced further social distancing measures and instructed people to avoid social contact and gatherings where possible and avoid non-essential travel. British Gymnastics and London Gymnastics had cancelled all the international, national and regional events until the end of June 2020, including Open championships, Zonal grades and NDP Finals.

All Rhythmic Excellence coaches are now working on ONLINE training provision for our SQUAD and RECREATIONAL gymnasts starting from this Thursday as per current timetable. Additionally, theoretical lectures on sport training and judging will be provided in the form of presentations and videos. We are already working on this project and we will send all the details soon.

We thank you all for your understanding and support, all the nice emails we're receiving are really appreciated.

Please keep safe in this hard time.

RE Team
