Well done to all our gymnasts who attended our Club Competition :)

Thank you for joining us this afternoon and support our girls, we're very happy for today results and are extremely proud of all our gymnasts, this event wouldn't have been possible without all of you but especially without **Jelena**, **Isabel**, **Kim** and **Renie** and our great team of coaches/judges **Veronica**, **Asia**, **Francesca**, **Eleonora** and **Stefano**.

...and to our lucky ruffle winners:
