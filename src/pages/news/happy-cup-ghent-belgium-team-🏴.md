**Saffron** and **Leyla** for _Team England_ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿

Great news from Belgium from our gymnasts Saffron Severn and Leyla Yilmaz who have represented Team England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 at the 22nd edition of the FIG Tournament "Happy Cup".

Saffron has performed for the last time her junior rope routine receiving a good 13.150 followed by a great 14.350 for her new senior ball routine (personal best), new senior clubs too (with a mark deduction) for a brilliant 13.750 and to conclude not the best ribbon performance but a starting point with the senior size.

Leyla has performed her best ball routine (13.600) followed by a good rope routine (12.200). On the second day the other 2 apparatus did not go as planned but still good for the beginning of the season.
