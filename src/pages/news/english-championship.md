We're very proud of our junior **Saffron** who won the Bronze overall medal at the 2019 English Championship and won in finals: Bronze in clubs, Silver in rope and (despite breaking her ribbon stick after 6 sec of her routine) Gold and therefore Ribbon English Champion ðŸ’ª

Congratulations to her and well done to all coaches and judges who supported RE and thanks Saffron's family for always being there ðŸ˜Š

Our little blueberries had a great experience attending such an important event for the first time, the path is long and taught but we're working hard **\*Adriana**, **Vasilisa**, **Alina**, **Tehila** and **Kaela*** ðŸ’œ
